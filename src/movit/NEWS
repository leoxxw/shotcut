Movit 1.1.3, March 29th, 2015

  - Fix accuracy issues in ResampleEffect, particularly when
    zooming. Note that this might cost a few percent performance.
    Reported by Christophe Thommeret.

  - Make the number of BlurEffect taps configurable.
    Based on patch by Christophe Thommeret.

  - Multiple other bugfixes, some courtesy Dan Dennedy and
    Christophe Thommeret. In particular, thread-safety fixes
    related to locales and chain finalization.


Movit 1.1.2, August 12th, 2014

  - Performance bugfix: Fix texture freelist behavior so that it's
    LRU instead of the exact opposite. Patch by Christophe Thommeret.

  - Performance bugfix: Correct the number of blur taps read in the
    blur filter (it was reading about twice as many as it should).
    Also found by Christophe Thommeret.


Movit 1.1.1, April 12th, 2014

 - Fix an issue that could cause assertion failure in ResourcePool
   when FBOs are reused, especially with NVIDIA's drivers.


Movit 1.1, April 10th, 2014

 - NOTE: Movit now uses libepoxy rather than GLEW. This is needed because
   of core context and GLES3 support (see below). Movit 1.1 should be
   generally API-compatible with 1.0.3 (with the exception of the next
   point), but is not ABI-compatible, so there has been a soname bump
   to libmovit.so.2.

 - NOTE: The rules for using an EffectChain or ResourcePool in multiple
   OpenGL contexts or threads have changed somewhat; see the comments in
   resource_pool.h.

 - Movit will now work in OpenGL core contexts, and on GLES 3.0 or newer.
   (GLES2 devices are not supported.) This also holds for all unit tests,
   provided that you use SDL2 and not SDL1 (because SDL2 is needed to set
   up such contexts). Note that the included demo application still requires
   a classic OpenGL context.

 - ResampleEffect can now do sub-pixel translate and/or zoom.

 - LumaMixEffect now has an “invert” flag, as a convenience to e.g. change
   a left-to-right wipe into a right-to-left one.

 - Significant reduction in driver overhead, especially on NVIDIA drivers.

 - Various smaller bugfixes and performance improvements.


Movit 1.0.3, March 16th, 2014

 - Yet more build system tweaks mainly related to distribution packaging.


Movit 1.0.2, March 16th, 2014

 - Make a few tweaks to “make install”, to make distributions' lives easier.


Movit 1.0.1, March 16th, 2014

 - Fix so that shared libraries are built.


Movit 1.0, March 16th, 2014

 - Initial release.
