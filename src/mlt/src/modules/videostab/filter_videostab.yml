  This filter is deprecated and will eventually be removed; use the vidstab
  filter instead.
  This filter requires two passes. The first pass performs analysis and stores
  the result in the vectors property. The second pass applies the vectors to
  the image.
  To use with melt, use 'melt ... -consumer xml:output.mlt all=1' for the
  first pass. For the second pass, use output.mlt as the input.

      When this is not supplied, the filter computes the vectors and stores
      them in this property when the last frame has been processed.
